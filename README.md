# ESP32 APRS All in One
Your ESP32 device works as a tracker (without internet) or as a mobile Aprs tracker application (if you share your mobile internet with ESP32).
You have to connect your external GPS TX & RX pins to RX2 & TX2 pins of ESP32 WROOM 32D and supply power of Gps with 3.3v pin and GND of ESP32.

Kicad design builded with great helps of my friend TA2PLT.
